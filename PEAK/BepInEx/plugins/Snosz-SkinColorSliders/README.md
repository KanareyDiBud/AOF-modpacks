# Skin Color Sliders

Lets you customize your head/body/blush colors with rgb sliders allowing for full rgb color range, and syncs up with all players. Lets you add other custom preset skin mods without needing other players to have it, they only need SkinColorSliders installed.

All players will need this mod installed for it to sync.

- Fixed problem with mod just not working at all (Im sorry for catching this so late).
- Players who do not have the mod should now appear as the color they have selected instead of white
- Players who do not have the mod will now see you as the color index you have selected instead of the default orange.
- Joining the game now more reliably updates the skin colors of other players that have been applied prior to you joining.

[1.1.0] <br>
- Ghosts, flares, and the scout report should now properly show the player's selected color.
- The preset skin color options are now selectable meaning you can use the default options as well as other skin mods that provide preset colors without needing everyone to have that mod, they only need to have SkinColorSliders installed.

## How To Use

1.  When inside the Airport, opening your passport will show new controls under the passport photo.
2.  To set a new color, first adjust each slider to see how they affect the character in the passport photo.
3.  When you are ready to set your color, hit the Apply button below the sliders.

## Installation

1.  Download the mod zip file.
2.  Move the SkinColorSliders.dll file inside the downloaded zip file into your BepInEx plugins folder located where you have installed Peak.
3.  Delete the old version of the mod (which may be in a folder called SkinColorSliders) if you have it.
4.  Run the game and load into a new run. If sliders appear under the passport photo it means the installation was a success.
