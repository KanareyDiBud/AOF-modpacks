### Features
* Sets the Player cap to a game friendly 20

(I've decided to make it 20, so theres no lags (+ the devs may rest without paying more money for a server)

- No more nicknames tweaking around, everyone gets their OWN nickname!

- Everyone get's their own marshmallow!

* The Campfire will keep you all warm and hungerless

* The Campfire wont burn out at all, so you dont have to worry about not cooking your marshmallows!
