# MicMuteToggle

Toggle your microphone mute/unmute in PEAK with a hotkey â€” now with an on-screen mute icon.


## What does this mod do?

- **MicMuteToggle** adds a hotkey (default `M`) to instantly mute or unmute your microphone in PEAK.
- When muted, a red mic-with-slash icon appears on your HUD as a visual indicator. When unmuted, the icon disappears.
- Designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.


## Features

- **Hotkey mute/unmute:** Press `M` (customizable) to toggle your mic at any time.
- **Visual mute status:** See a clear icon when your mic is muted â€” never wonder if others can hear you!
- **Simple, silent, and fast:** No extra menus or bloat.


## Installation

1. **Install [BepInEx 5.4.2403 for PEAK](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_PEAK/)** if you havenâ€™t already.
2. Download the latest release of **MicMuteToggle** from Thunderstore.
3. Extract the `.dll` file and the `Images/MicMuted.png` file into your `PEAK/BepInEx/plugins/MicMuteToggle/` folder.
4. Launch PEAK. The mod will load automatically.


## Usage

- Press `M` (or your configured hotkey) in-game to mute/unmute your mic.
- When muted, you'll see a red microphone icon with a slash at the bottom-left of your HUD.
- The icon disappears when unmuted.

**To change the hotkey:**
- Edit `BepInEx/config/com.peak.micmutetoggle.cfg` and set the `ToggleMuteKey` to any [valid Unity KeyCode]


## Why use this mod?

- **Instant privacy:** Mute yourself without alt-tabbing or fiddling with voice chat menus.
- **No confusion:** Always know if youâ€™re muted with the on-screen indicator.
